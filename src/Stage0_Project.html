      <h2>The World Wide Web (WWW)</h2>
      <p>
        The internet is a network of computers communicating with each other,
        establishing links that make up the 'web'. The key actors involved in
        this web are: <br />
        the <b>client</b> that has a web 'browser' such as <em>Google Chrome</em> or <em>Firefox</em>,
        the <b>internet</b> itself,
        the <b>communications protocol</b> - for instance <em>HTTP</em>,
        and <b>servers</b> that serve content such as <em>HTML documents along with images, videos and so on</em>.

      <h2>How Computers Process Commands</h2>
      <p>
        Computers process instructions <em>literally</em>, meaning they can't make handle
        multiple inferences of a statement (unless they are <b>trained</b> to do so).
        <br />
        This implies that computers can't deal with <b>ambuiguity</b> and hence are very sensitive to typos and
        mistakes.

      <h2>HTML: The Basics</h2>
      <h3>Tags, Elements, Attributes</h3>
      <p>
        <b>Tags</b> are the <em>building blocks</em> of HTML. Almost every new idea in HTML is enclosed in
        opening and closing tags, with the exception of certain self closing tags such as img and br.
        <br />
        <b>Attributes</b> are <em>properties</em> of HTML tags that may or may not have values and specify details of how the element should behave.
        <b>Elements</b> can be understood as a complete html idea or tag, having independent existence in the DOM.
      </p>
      <h3>Inline and Block Elements</h3>
      <p>
        The core idea is that block elements such as <b>'p', 'div', 'form'</b> have an independent box or container that creates a line break,
        while inline elements such as <b>'a', 'img'</b> allow you to continue on the same line.
      </p>
      <p>
        It may be noted that <b>'br'</b> is an <em>inline</em> element, although it may appear to behave as block.
