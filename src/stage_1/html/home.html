                    The internet is a network of computers communicating with each other, establishing links that make up the 'web'. The key actors involved in this web are: <br /> the <b>client</b> that has a web 'browser' such as <em>Google Chrome</em> or <em>Firefox</em>, the <b>internet</b> itself, the <b>communications protocol</b> - for instance <em>HTTP</em>, and <b>servers</b> that serve content such as <em>HTML documents along with images, videos and so on</em>.

                <p class="card-description">
                    Computers process instructions <em>literally</em>, meaning they can't make handle multiple inferences of a statement (unless they are <b>trained</b> to do so).
                    <br /> This implies that computers can't deal with <b>ambuiguity</b> and hence are very sensitive to typos and mistakes.

                <h4 class="card-sub-title">Tags, Elements, Attributes</h4>
                <p class="card-description">
                    <b>Tags</b> are the <em>building blocks</em> of HTML. Almost every new idea in HTML is enclosed in opening and closing tags, with the exception of certain self closing tags such as img and br.
                    <br />
                    <b>Attributes</b> are <em>properties</em> of HTML tags that may or may not have values and specify details of how the element should behave.
                    <b>Elements</b> can be understood as a complete html idea or tag, having independent existence in the DOM.

                <h4 class="card-sub-title">Inline and Block Elements</h4>
                <p class="card-description">
                    The core idea is that block elements such as <b>'p', 'div', 'form'</b> have an independent box or container that creates a line break, while inline elements such as <b>'a', 'img'</b> allow you to continue on the same line.
                    <br> It may be noted that <b>'br'</b> is an <em>inline</em> element, although it may appear to behave as block.

                <p class="card-description">
                    CSS is a simple mechanism for adding style to Web documents. Using a house analogy, HTML can be considered as the <b>pillars</b> while CSS is the paint and everything else that gives it shape and looks.
                    <br>
                    CSS helps avoid repetition of code by allowing re-use of styles.
                    <br>
                    CSS files can be linked to HTML document using the <b>link</b> tag with 'rel' as <em>'stylesheet'</em>

                <p class="card-description">
                    CSS allows for a lot of <b>flexibility</b> in styling a web page. Elements can be selected using <em>tag, class or attribute</em>.
                    <br />
                    The <b>box-styling</b> property allows you to structure elements easily based on <em>margin, border and padding</em> dimensions.
                    <br />
                    Content can be <b>organised</b> into containers such as <em>div, span</em> and can be styled as required.

                    The flex box layout can be activated by setting display property to <b>'flex'</b> and enables a number of cool features to style your web page, as demonstrated by this one.
