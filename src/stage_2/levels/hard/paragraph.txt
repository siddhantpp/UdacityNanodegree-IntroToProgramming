When you create a __1__, certain __2__s are automatically
generated for you if you don't make them manually. These contain multiple
underscores before and after the word defining them.  When you write
a __1__, you almost always include at least the __3__ __2__, defining
variables for when __4__s of the __1__ get made.  Additionally, you generally
want to create a __5__ __2__, which will allow a string representation
of the method to be viewed by other developers.

You can also create binary operators, like __6__ and __7__, which
allow + and - to be used by __4__s of the __1__.  Similarly, __8__,
__9__, and __10__ allow __4__s of the __1__ to be compared
(with <, >, and ==).
