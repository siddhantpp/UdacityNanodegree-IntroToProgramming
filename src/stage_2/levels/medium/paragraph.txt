A __1__ is created with the def keyword. You specify the inputs a __1__ takes by
adding __2__ separated by commas between the parentheses. __1__s by default return __3__ if you
don't specify the value to return. __2__ can be standard data types such as string, number, dictionary,
tuple, and __4__ or can be more complicated such as objects and lambda functions.
